# Beagle
Beagle is a browser extension that informs users about items that are potentially counterfeit on major online marketplaces. It was submitted for the 2022 Amazon-George Mason University-TraCCC hackathon on counterfeiting and was in the top 11 submissions to reach the final stage. 

# Installation


### Windows
To quickly test the browser extension along the lines of "plug and play" simply click the file <b> beagle.crx </b> and download it. When you open the file, on Windows, a screen should inform you about how you wish to open the file. Select either Google Chrome (preferred) or Mozilla Firefox. The extension also works on Microsoft Edge and Safari but there is a different process that has to be followed and is outlined below.

### Mac
